# Upstream TDD
A simple testing framework for HTTP services, as well as for any other platform that posts test results via a REST Api.

## Getting started
1. You can use the public deployment at [https://tdd.upstr.dev](https://tdd.upstr.dev), or deploy or run your own version.
2. First start a test with a curl command. You will get an `id` back that you can use to update and monitor results.
```sh
# init test
curl -X POST https://tdd.upstr.dev/tests -H "Content-Type: application/yaml" \
  --data-binary @- << EOF

tests:
  - name: test response headers.Host prop
   	url: https://httpbin.org
    path: /get
    verb: get
    assertions:
      - $.headers.Host===httpbin.org
EOF
```
3. The `tests` and `assertions` collections can contain as many tests as needed.
4. To use with Apigee proxies, deploy a proxy with the test policies enabled like in the example in the `apigee` directory.
5. Monitor the test results at [https://tdd.upstr.dev/dash?id=YOUR_ID](https://tdd.upstr.dev/dash).

## Background info
- The purpose of this project is to provide a pragmatic, "batteries included" test setup for TDD for different kinds of services, including HTTP and Apigee proxies. Everything is contained in a single service that can easily be deployed anywhere. No database or other infrastructure is required - just a container and a file system, which can easily be provided with scale-to-zero support in [Google Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run) and [Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage).
- In this first version, a test UUID is generated when a test suite is created, and which is used to identify the test suite for all subsequent operations. The UUID is never shown again, so it must be treated as a secret that allows a user or client to view / edit / delete the test suite rules and results. This follows the first principle of being pragmatic and fast.

## Credits
- The frontend code was initially generated by [Gemini 2.5 Flash](https://deepmind.google/models/gemini/flash/), and then adapted and polished based on the requirements.
